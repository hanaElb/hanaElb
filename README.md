## My Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

#### BusSys:(https://github.com/MustafaIsmail10/busSys) - worked on a collaborative bus routing system with a classmate. 
- There were 4 phases of the project which included:
1. Creating Class library
2. Clientâ€“Server application
3. Web application with static content
4. Dynamic web application
- For 1st phase we used python and wrote a command line test application demonstrating all features of the library.
- In the 2nd phase using python we implemented a server application creating instances of the class library and let clients connect and interact with them.
- In the 3rd phase we wrote a Django based web application to interact with a browser.
- Lastly in the final phase we brought everything together after adding JavaScript, web sockets and CSS to enhance the user experience.
